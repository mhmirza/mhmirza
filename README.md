I am Manzoor, currently pursuing Master's in Data Analytics at Carnegie Mellon University. Prior to joining graduate school, I was working with GlaxoSmithKline Pakistan Limited based out of Karachi, Pakistan. My work there primarily involved customer insights, which helped me develop a profound interest in how data could be used to facilitate commercial decision making. My time at Carnegie Mellon University has allowed me to delve deeper into this interest and enabled me to understand the role of analytics in business and policy. 

## So far, I have learnt how to:

* Derive meaning from data to furnish compelling narratives: Check out my Data Visualization portfolio [here](https://mhmirza.github.io/DataViz/)!

* Use decision analytics to facilitate preemptive and optimal decision making: Check out my Optimization portfolio [here](https://mhmirza.github.io/Optimization/)!

* Use machine learning algorithms on big data to draw current & future business insights: Check out my Big Data portfolio [here](https://mhmirza.github.io/BigData/)!

* Design research experiments to answer causal questions of interest: Check out my A/B testing portfolio [here](https://mhmirza.github.io/ABTesting/)!

* Discover structure in data and make predictions to solve complex business problems: Check out my Data Mining portfolio [here](https://mhmirza.github.io/DataMining/)!

* Write programs for web-based applications that could help improve interactions with customers: Check out my Advanced Python portfolio [here](https://mhmirza.github.io/PythonProgramming/)!

* Use statistical analysis and modeling to uncover and address key policy issues: Check out my R Programming portfolio [here](https://mhmirza.github.io/RAnalytics/)!

* Use advanced visualization techniques to discern underlying trends in data: Check out my Descriptive Analytics portfolio [here](https://mhmirza.github.io/DescriptiveAnalytics/)!

### Hi there!

I am Manzoor, currently pursuing Master's in Data Analytics at Carnegie Mellon University. Prior to joining graduate school, I was working with GlaxoSmithKline Pakistan Limited based out of Karachi, Pakistan. My work there primarily involved customer insights, which helped me develop a profound interest in how data could be used to facilitate commercial decision making. My time at Carnegie Mellon University has allowed me to delve deeper into this interest and enabled me to understand the role of analytics in business and policy. 

#### So far, I have learnt how to:

* Derive meaning from data to tell compelling stories -> Check out my data visualization portfolio [here](https://github.com/mhmirza/DataViz)!
* Use decision analytics to facilitate preemptive and optimal decision making -> Check out my optimization portfolio [here](https://github.com/mhmirza/Optimization)!
* Use machine learning algorithms on big data to draw underlying insights -> Check out my big data portfolio [here](https://github.com/mhmirza/BigData)!
* Design research experiments to answer causal questions of interest -> Check out my A/B testing portfolio [here](https://github.com/mhmirza/ABTesting)!
* Discover structure in data and make predictions to solve complex business problems -> Check out my Data Mining portfolio [here](https://github.com/mhmirza/DataMining)!
* Write programs for web-based applications that could improve interactions with customers -> Check out my Python portfolio [here](https://github.com/mhmirza/PythonProgramming)!
* Discern patterns in data that could help furnish key policies -> Check out my R portfolio [here](https://github.com/mhmirza/RAnalytics)!

...But there is still a long way for me to go so please feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manzoorhassanmirza/) if you have any comments/ suggestions regarding my portfolio or would like to share your experience in Data Analytics!
